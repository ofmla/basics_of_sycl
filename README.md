# Introduction to SYCL Programming: A Beginner's Guide

This repository provides simple programs that cover the basics of SYCL programming and its usage. It includes:

- Apptainer recipes to build containers with the necessary dependencies.
- C++ programs for different applications designed to explain key SYCL features.

The course is designed to equip programmers with no prior SYCL knowledge with basic skills, preparing them to write a practical example in the geoscience domain (wave modeling simulations).
